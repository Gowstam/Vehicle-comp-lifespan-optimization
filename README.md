# Vehicle-comp-lifespan-optimization
This project focuses on analyzing vehicle telemetry data and predicting component failures using Python-based data analysis and machine learning. The goal is to improve vehicle reliability, efficiency, and component lifespan by identifying patterns in synthetic telemetry data and forecasting potential failures.

Features:
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and normalizes telemetry data, handles missing values.
Label Creation: Generates failure labels and remaining useful life (RUL) metrics from time-based data.
Machine Learning Models:
RandomForestClassifier for predicting failure events.
RandomForestRegressor for estimating remaining useful life of components.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, confusion matrix, mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE).
Visualization: Produces plots and charts to compare predictions vs. actual failures.
Artifacts: Saves trained models and analysis outputs for reuse.
